For the past hour:

 



Bonus Question:

-	Yes, externalising the global parameter 'min collection interval', which defaults to 0, into the corresponding YAML file, will allow to update the YAML file without touching the PY class definition Agent Check, itself. Thus, the interval can be set and updated in the corresponding YAML, as it must be.  In fact, this is the best practice way of creating a controllable class in PY/Java, all key parameters need to be read in from an external YAML/interface/config files. 


Visualizing Data


-	Allocated both API and APP keys for my Timeboard script

 


-	Created the following Python script to create the Timeboard via DD API


from datadog import initialize, api

options = {
    'api_key': 'c754da805dfcf11ab28b07fa3064ebe8',
    'app_key': 'e97426651d8885ac22d09fb9a9b6cdc03026b1f4'
}

initialize(**options)

title = "Lloyd's Timeboard"
description = "Timeboard for MongoDB / MacOS."
graphs = [{
    "definition": {
        "events": [],
        "requests": [
                  {"q": "my_metric{*} by {host}"},
                  {"q": "anomalies(avg:mongodb.connections.current{*},'adaptive',2)"},
                  {"q": "sum:my_metric{*}"}
        ],
        "viz": "timeseries"
    },
    "title": "My Custom Metric & MongoDB Connections View"
}]

template_variables = [{
    "name": "SLDTTMacBookAir.home",
    "prefix": "host",
    "default": "host:my-host"
}]

read_only = True
api.Timeboard.create(title=title,

Timeboard with Postman 

Postman is a technology partner with DD and as such they integrate natively with DD web portal, also providing an ability for me to bypass the environment constraints and execute JSON scripts with DD POST API requests. 

Postman Set-Up

 


Note: request type set to POST, pointing to the DD Dash API endpoint. Both my account's allocated API Key and APP Key are set as DD environment pre-sets and are constructed into the post API call/URL.

My script sent in the body of the Timeboard POST request:


{
      "graphs" : [{
          "title": "CUSTOM MY_METRIC / MONGO DB CONNECTIONS W. ANOMALY DETECTION",
          "definition": {
              "events": [],
              "requests": [
              	  {"q": "my_metric{*} by {host}"},
                            {"q": "anomalies(avg:mongodb.connections.current{*},'adaptive',2)"},
                            {"q": "sum:my_metric{*}"}
              ]
          },

DataDog Dashboard (Timeboards) View

 


Zoom-in on the 3 Timeboard metrics created via the DD API post

 

The 3 metrics positioned on one graph associated with this Timeboard:

 










My Timeboard Settings View:

 



Overall view over 1 hour of the 2 metrics (my_metric, mongodb.connections.current) being monitored

 

My metrics (my_metric and mongodb.connections.current) zoomed to 5 minutes on the Timeboard UI

 



 

The notated 5-minute metric snapshot is e-mailed to myself from my DD Cloud account


 

Note: My DD anomaly function watches the MongoDB connections being open over a period of time. The number of connections is 2 most of the time, which is on average 500 times less than my random number gauge, that powers my_metric range. As such, the way the anomaly function shows itself on the graph (as above) is at the very bottom. It is, unfortunately, disproportionately smaller than the custom metric's output of random numbers between 1 and 1000. 
â€¦



Bonus Question: My anomaly function for Mongo DB connections is set to be adaptive and that is why this type of algorithm application will work best when my open MongoDB connections will be out of their 'normal' range - currently 2 connections at a time.  It shows if my Mongo DB connections will exceed their normal observed threshold. The anomaly function by DD is a very useful capability, which makes the solution extremely powerful in scenarios where hosted apps can produce sudden spikes of data/fluctuations, but which is perfectly normal for these applications, ex. MongoDB within an enterprise where query throughput grows exponentially at a certain hour of the day. A MongoDB instance can log a sudden spike of queries during the day and when we apply DD anomalies() function, it will look at this app performance from the historical perspective. Thus, although, this spike may look as a problem in the context of now and today, it is predictable and was historically observed time and time before. DD anomalies() function, when applied to a metric, will look at its logging performance in the context of its behaviour historically and will analyse whether this spike is, in fact, within this metric historically documented performance 'range'. Practically, it is also useful to apply this function over metrics known to fluctuate to avoid false alerts when, indeed, their behaviour is statistically within limits.

Monitoring Data

Monitoring is set up on my_metric as requested with alerting, warning and no data email notifications demonstrated below.

Alert monitoring message in email
(please note the alert type messaging within the email)

 


Warning monitoring message in email
(please note the warning type messaging within the email)

 

No data monitoring message in email
(please note the no data type messaging within the email)
In order to simulate the no data scenario, I disabled my DD agent running on my host for more than 10 minutes and this produced the desired no data type email messaging as below.

 


Alert, Warning, and No data monitors set up on my DD Cloud Account.

 

My monitor showing all the 3 states of Alert, Warning and No data taken place in the last hour
(the history legend shows all of the 3 states in red, orange and grey)

 


Bonus Question: I created the 2 scheduled downtimes as planned. One to cover a daily period from 7PM until 9 AM in the morning of the next business day, and the other - to mute the Alert/Warning/No data type messages for the entire weekend (Saturday/Sunday).


 


 



 

 



Final Bonus Question:

My creative way of using DataDog Cloud Monitoring: At Prism Skylabs (www.prism.com) we monitor IoT devices (IP cameras and others) and sensors located in our customer sites around the world, as such, we are in 100+ countries now. It is humanly impossible to know what is happening to every sensor at any given point in time. We rely on some basics internal dashboard to email our Support Team when any sensor was unresponsive for more than 20min. DataDog will be ideal solution for that, we would have our own Support-run DD cloud account, an API channel to send us/and our customers directly, alerts when any particular IoT sensor is down or has not been responsive for a few minutes. This capability is essential to our customers, as, historically, we ran into lots of issues for the last 2 years when we could not guarantee our SLA, vital to our contract extension and upsell potential on the accounts. The losses we incurred would justify the subscription fees already, or these fees could be factored into our pricing.
